# WRAPSHOP
This document is intended to outline the features of
an online shopping system so that it can act as a
guide for programmers and a software validation
document for potential customers. The goal of the
web application for the online shopping system is to
offer a comprehensive solution to both merchants
and customers.
It will make it possible for Operators to put up
online stores that customers can explore and buy
from without having to physically visit the stores.
Operators can manage products from the admin
panel.

A system administrator will be able to maintain a
variety of shop categories and request new shops
using the administrator module.
Customers residing in various parts of the world
need to be able to purchase various product
categories from the online shopping system. All
products will be shown on the website in a
classified manner. Customers can browse through
any product to learn more about it, including its
pricing, and place an order. Orders must include
shipping and billing information. The order amount
can be paid for by customers using a credit card,
debit card, net banking, or cash (cash on delivery).
The systemâ€™s primary goal is to make it easy for
people to explore and purchase goods from
anywhere in the world, expanding the potential for
business.
General description

Customers can browse through the shops using the
online shopping system program, vendors can build
up their own online stores, and system
administrators can accept or deny requests to add
new stores and keep lists of store categories.
Additionally, the developer is creating an online
store to handle the merchandise in the stores and
assist clients in making purchases without physically
visiting the stores. Clients can use our website to
sell their goods.
